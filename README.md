# Academic-Activity-Manager
Academic Activity Manager was intended to use in our Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
It keeps all the information of teachers, students, results, notes, documents and other related
contents. It also has automatic notification system when something is announced by the admin or teacher.
The result is automatically published in on the App to be viewed by students. Students have the
ability to register in the App by providing necessary information. This App uses google's Firebase for
notification system and made with Java, PHP using Android Studio.
